App Idea:
I would like to add a new feature to the Instagram App. Aside from being a popular app used to view photos and videos, Instagram is also widely used to text and message friends and family. Although the app already has a option to search for stickers and gifs that can be sent during chats, sometimes the results shown are not what users are looking for or users may already have their own stickers/gifs saved in their phone that they perfer to send. Therefore, I would like to add a feature that allows users to upload their own stickers and gifs from their camera roll. By addiing this feature, it takes out the hassle of users having to constantly scroll through their camera rolls to find the sticker/gifs they want. Instead, they will just have to add it once and be able to easily select and click on the stickers/gifs again when they need them.

## Notes

A challenge I encountered while making the app was calling the function that changes the background color when the button is clicked. I was confused on where to add the two lines and mistakenly placed the lines within the changeColor function. But, after testing the app out and realizing that the button did not change the background when it was clicked on, I realized that my placement was wrong and fixed my mistake.
